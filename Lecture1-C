#Collection of notes in the C language

Scratch:          Say(hello, world)

'''C
printf(hello, world/n");
'''

All printed words are called strings and strings are enclosed "string" <br>
n tells computer to start a new line <br>
The ; is like the period at the end of a sentence. It tells the computer that this is the end of the statement.

Scratch: Set counter to 0

'''C
int counter = 0;
'''

In C you must declare the type of variables you are creatig

Scratch: Change counter by 1

'''C
counter = counter + 1; # add any number to counter;
counter + = 1 # add any number to counter;
counter++ # only adds plus 1 counter;
'''

The = sign is not "equals", it means "assign" or "get".

Once you have created a variable, you do not need to keep telling the computer what type of variable ot will be such as "int".

'''C
if (x<y) them
{
      printf("x is less than y/n);
}
'''

Scratch: If x<y then 
say x is less than y
else
say x is not less than y

'''C
      if (x < y)
{
      printf("x is less than y/n);
}
else
{
      print ("x is not less then y/n);
}
'''
In scratch 1 = sign represents equality
In C, 2 equal signs shows equality

You need to keyword true to create a forever loop becauseyou need to ask the computer a question that will always be true and the word true by defintion

The % makes a placeholder

A return value is something that the user writes back to the computer

For a loop, you need to know how many times you want to execute the code 
How many times you want to execute the code
Then constantly make sure that one does not exceed the other.



#include <stdio.h>

int maln(void)
{
      printf("hello, world/n");
}
